* About LuaDocer
  -------------
  LuaDocer is a documentation generation tool for the Lua language. It produces
  standalone HTML documentation for the given projects, which documents all
  files, functions, variables and tables that are used in the project.
  Documentation comments are used to supply documentation data into the final
  documentation of the project.

  Output of LuaDocer also contains a lot of lists, metrics and statistics, such as
  an alphabetical index of all global functions used in the project, source code
  syntax-aware highlighter, formatter and much more. Many aspects of the final
  documentation can be easily configured to suit everyone's needs.

  LuaDocer is a fork (an enhanced version) of LuaDoc.
